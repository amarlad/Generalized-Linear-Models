LinearRegression fits a linear model with coefficients  to minimize the residual sum of squares between the observed responses in 
the dataset, and the responses predicted by the linear approximation. Mathematically it solves a problem of the form:
LinearRegression will take in its fit method arrays X, y and will store the coefficients  of the linear model in its coef_member:
